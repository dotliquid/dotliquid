# DotLiquid Breaking Changes

## 2017-06-17

1. In order to fix compatibility issues from last version some modification have been made on historic operator keys in `Condition.Operators`: 
  - startswith -> startsWith
  - endswith -> endsWith

They can be used as before but if you manipulate them through their key, be sure to update your code to avoid any error.

2. For the same fix `INamingConvention` have now a new member: `bool OperatorEquals(string testedOperator, string referenceOperator)`
It is used in order to allow all operator to be compared through the naming convention specific:
  - ruby: snake_case e.g. starts_with
  - c#: pascalCase or PascalCase e.g; startsWith or StartsWith
Operators can still be used in lower case.

Capital letters are allowed in conditional operators, but they must have the correct capitalization to work in the template.
eg: {% if "bob" startswith "b" %} vs {% if "bob" StartsWith "b" %} or {% if "bob" starts_with "b" %}
