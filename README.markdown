### What is this?

DotLiquid is a .Net port of the popular [Ruby Liquid templating
language](http://liquidmarkup.org/). It is a separate project that aims to
retain the same template syntax as the original, while using .NET coding
conventions where possible.

For more information about the original Liquid project, see
<http://www.liquidmarkup.org>.

### Quick start

1. Download the latest release from the [downloads
   page](https://github.com/dotliquid/dotliquid/downloads).  The zip file
   contains DotLiquid.dll, which is the only one you need.
2. Read the [wiki](https://github.com/dotliquid/dotliquid/wiki) for information
   on writing and using DotLiquid templates.

### Why should I use DotLiquid?

* You want to leave business logic in your compiled controllers and out of your templates.
* You're looking for a logic-less template language that also exists for other platforms (ie: node, python).
* You want to allow your users to edit their own page templates, but want to
  ensure they don't run insecure code.
* You want to render templates directly from the database.
* You want a template engine for emails.

### What does it look like?

``` liquid
<ul id="products">
  {% for product in products %}
    <li>
      <h2>{{product.name}}</h2>
      Only {{product.price | price }}

      {{product.description | prettyprint | paragraph }}
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
```

### How to use DotLiquid

DotLiquid supports a very simple API based around the DotLiquid.Template class.
Generally, you can read the contents of a file into a template, and then render
the template by passing it parameters in the form of a `Hash` object. There are
several ways you can construct a `Hash` object, including from a Dictionary, or
using the `Hash.FromAnonymousObject` method.

  Template template = Template.Parse("hi {{name}}"); // Parses and compiles the template
  template.Render(Hash.FromAnonymousObject(new { name = "tobi" })); // => "hi tobi"
